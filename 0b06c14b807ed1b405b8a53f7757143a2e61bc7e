Discarded:
- reauthor: the filter run on every object can probably be optimised even more
  to only include the minimal checks and assignments necessary given the
  options. That could speed up the rewrite, and maybe prevent change mistakes.
  => premature optimization
- reauthor: use range of filter-branch to only rewrite a subset of the commits
  and tags
  => no real use case
 (change of work that could be reflected in email change from a specific date?)
- reauthor: allow for regex partial replace to change for example just a domain
  's/(.*)@perso.me/\1@work.com/'
  => probably overkill for now
- reauthor: allow other filter-branch options -d. --original,...
  => probably overkill as well for now
